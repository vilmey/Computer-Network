For starters, the abstract objects that make up the layers of a network system are called protocols. That is, a protocol provides a communication service that
higher-level objects (such as application processes, or perhaps higher-
level protocols) use to exchange messages. For example, we could imagine
a network that supports a request/reply protocol and a message stream
protocol, corresponding to the request/reply and message stream chan-
nels discussed above.




To summarize, a protocol defines a communication service that it
exports locally (the service interface), along with a set of rules governing
the messages that the protocol exchanges with its peer(s) to implement
this service (the peer interface)
